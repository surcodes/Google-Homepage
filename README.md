# Google Homepage Clone

This project is a simple clone of the **Google homepage** built using only **HTML** and **CSS**.  
The goal of this project was to practice front-end basics, layout structuring, and styling to replicate a familiar UI.

---

## 🚀 Features
- A responsive navigation bar with links (About, Store, Gmail, Images).
- A search bar styled similar to Google’s, with icons for search and mic.
- Buttons for "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky".
- Footer with panels (India, Advertising, Business, How Search Works, Privacy, Terms, Settings).
- Profile picture and menu icons styled to mimic the real homepage. 

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3 (Flexbox, styling basics)**

---

## 📚 What I Learned
Through this project, I learned:
- How to structure a webpage layout using semantic HTML.
- Using **Flexbox** (`justify-content`, `align-items`, `gap`) for positioning.
- Creating reusable CSS classes for hover effects and spacing.
- Styling form inputs (search bar with icons).
- Handling margins/padding effectively to reduce unwanted spacing.
- How small details (like icon sizes, spacing, and hover states) can make a UI look polished.

## 🔮 Next Steps
- Make the layout fully responsive for mobile devices.
- Add interactivity (JavaScript for search bar, button clicks).
- Improve accessibility with `aria-labels` and better semantic tags.
